                    Monitoring OpenSearch logs with Amazon CloudWatch Logs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createdomain-configure-slow-logs.html).

                    After you enable log publishing, you still have to enable the collection
                    of slow logs using the OpenSearch REST API.
